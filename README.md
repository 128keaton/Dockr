# Dockr
Dockr is a simple Docker management client for iOS. Still very much in alpha. 
## Features:
* Stop/Start Containers.
* Filter between running and all images.
* Basic container status (ports, IPs, uptime)

## Planned:
* Load..
* Searching/advance filtering.
* Deletion/Creation.

## Setup:
Build and run (iOS 7, Xcode 6), and [enable](http://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2014/07/quick-tip-how-to-enable-docker-remote-api.html) Docker remote API. 
If required, port forward to your machine (i.e remote management from outside your subnet).
